bs chicken boobs, cut into chunks

2 zucchini, sliced into rounds

6 mushrooms, sliced

optional onion, sliced

1/4 C water with 1 Tbs cornstarch mixed in

_sauce:_ 

1/4 C soy sauce

2 Tbs apple cider vinegar

1/4 tsp ginger 

1 tsp minced garlic

1 Tbs sugar

Add sauce ingredients to instant pot, then add chicken and onion. 

Seal and cook on high for 5 minutes. Immediately release the pressure, carefully. 

Stir in cornstarch slurry, and one minute later add zucchini, and stir. I know it's a full pot, but it works! 

This is amazing served with rice, or in lettuce wraps!
