description: These are so yummy on buns, with pineapple slices! If we don't have buns,
  we add pineapple chunks to the crock pot and serve over white rice, or in lettuce
  wraps. Yum!

1/2 C sugar

1/4 C apple cider vinegar (i have used white in a pinch, didn't notice a difference)

1 clove garlic, minced

3 Tbs soy sauce

1/2 tsp ginger

bs chicken boobs

\*for sandwiches - buns, pineapple slices, cheese

\*to eat without buns, over rice or lettuce, I cook pineapple chunks right into it in the crock

Place chicken in crock. In bowl, combine sugar, soy sauce, acv, ginger and garlic. Pour over chicken. Cook on low 7-9 hours. Shred chicken, assemble sandwiches, and enjoy!
