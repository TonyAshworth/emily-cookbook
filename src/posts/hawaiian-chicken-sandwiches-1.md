1/2 C sugar

1/4 C apple cider vinegar (i have used white in a pinch, didn't notice a difference)

1 clove garlic, minced

3 Tbs soy sauce

1/2 tsp ginger

bs chicken boobs

\*for sandwiches - buns, pineapple slices, cheese

\*to eat without buns, over rice or lettuce, I cook pineapple chunks right into it in the crock.

Place chicken in crock pot. In bowl, combine sugar, soy sauce, acv, ginger and garlic. Pour over chicken. Cook on low 7-9 hours. Shred chicken, assemble sandwiches, and enjoy!
