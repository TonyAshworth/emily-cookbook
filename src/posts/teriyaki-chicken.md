description: This is hands down the easiest recipe to make, and it wows everyone we
  make it for! My sister in law requests this every time she visits us. It is excellent
  served over rice! You can make this sauce for many proteins - it is good on beef,
  chicken, shrimp, even just veggies!

cooked protein - we prefer chicken, which we cut into bite sized pieces and saute in a skillet with a bit of oil. 

1 Tbs cornstarch mixed in 1/4 C water

1/2 C sugar

1/4  white vinegar

2 Tbs soy sauce 

Mix all in bowl. Once protein is cooked, pour sauce into skillet while hot and simmer until just thickened. Serve hot.
