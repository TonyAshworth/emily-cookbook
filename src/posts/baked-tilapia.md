This is very simple, and very loved by my family! 

Grab one tilapia fillet per person, and place them on a slightly oiled baking sheet. Drizzle oil on each fillet, then sprinkle your favorite seasoning on them - our favorites are Paul Prudhomme's Poultry Magic and any yummy bbq rub. Season generously! Bake in the oven at 400 degrees until the fish looks done, usually 20-25 minutes for us, and voila!
