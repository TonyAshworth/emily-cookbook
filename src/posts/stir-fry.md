protein - chicken, pork, shrimp, cut into bite sized pieces, or skip the protein!

veggies - personalize it! We love broccoli, snap peas, bell peppers, zucchini, onions, we sometimes even use the bags of frozen "asian veggies" and toss them in at the end. 

minced garlic to taste (we usually use a teaspoon)

_sauce:_ 

2 Tbs soy sauce

1/4 C water, with 2 Tbs cornstarch mixed in

1 Tbs sweet chili sauce (optional)

sprinkle of ginger, to taste

1 Tbs sesame oil

In a skillet, cook protein with a little oil until cooked through. Add garlic, and firmer veggies like onions. Saute a few minutes, until veggies start to soften. Add rest of veggies, pour sauce into skillet and simmer just until sauce thickens and remove from heat.
