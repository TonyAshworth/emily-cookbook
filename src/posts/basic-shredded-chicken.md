Plain shredded chicken is excellent to keep in the fridge for salads, to toss with noodles in alfredo sauce, to make nachos with beans and cheese and chips, I almost always have shredded cooked chicken on hand. 

Place bs chicken boobs in crock pot, cook on low for 3 hours, shred. Store in fridge for up to 4 days.
