As always, salads can be personalized to your own taste! This is a basic recipe of where we start:

* chopped romaine lettuce (you can use your fave)
* 2 ears of sweet corn, sliced off of the cob (or use canned, we love the taste and crunch of del monte summer crisp)
* can of black beans, drained and rinsed
* avocado, sliced or chopped
* handful of tortilla chips, crushed (blue corn chips are a nice color splash)
* ranch dressing
* salsa

Pico de gallo:

* 2 tomatoes, seeded and chopped
* 1/4 onion, minced
* 1/2 jalapeno (add more or skip, to taste) seeded and minced
* 1/4 C packed fresh cilantro (or a Tbs or two of squeeze bottle)
* juice of half a lime
* salt to taste

Make pico de gallo, can be done a day ahead. 

Stir together desired amts of ranch and salsa (I like half and half) and set aside. 

Mix salad together, and add desired amt of pico de gallo and dressing. Serve immediately.
