Another great gift to give over the holidays, just remember to make it ahead of time!

* 4 C hot, strong coffee
* 2 C white sugar
* 2 C brown sugar
* 3 C vodka or rum (the cheaper the better)
* 2 Tbs vanilla extract

Dissolve sugars in hot coffee, heat in a saucepan if necessary. Let cool.

Add vodka/rum and vanilla, and store in sealed bottles. This is best left in a cool dry place to settle for 6 weeks. The flavor will be very strong until it settles.
