* 1/4 C butter
* 1 1/4 C ginger snap cookies, finely crushed (blender does well for this)

Melt butter and mix into crushed ginger snaps. Press into either an 8 inch or 9 inch pie plate or springform pan. Follow pie directions.

If using with a no bake pie: press into an 8 inch pie plate and bake for seven minutes.
