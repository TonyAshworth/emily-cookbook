First recipe utilizes precooked protein, and you simply make the sauce and add to your protein. 

cooked protein of choice - we prefer bs chicken boobs, which we cut into bite sized pieces and cook in a skillet with a bit of oil until cooked through.

Sauce:

* 1/3 C Orange Juice
* 3 Tbs soy sauce
* 2 Tbs brown sugar
* 2 minced garlic cloves
* 1 Tbs rice/white vinegar

mixed together: 1/4 C water and 2 Tbs cornstarch

Mix together ingredients, and add to skillet with cooked protein of choice. Stir and simmer until thickened, and serve!

Second recipe cooks the chicken in an orange sauce, and has a tangier flavor. 

* 1 C orange juice
* 2 Tbs red currant jelly
* 1/2 C brown sugar
* 1-2lbs bs chicken breasts

Cube chicken and brown in skillet. Mix ingredients and add to pan. Simmer for 20 minutes covered, then 15 uncovered or until sauce thickens.
