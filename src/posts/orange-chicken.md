cooked protein of choice - we prefer bs chicken boobs, which we cut into bite sized pieces and cook in a skillet with a bit of oil until cooked through. 

Sauce: 

1/3 C Orange Juice

3 Tbs soy sauce

2 Tbs brown sugar

2 minced garlic cloves

1 Tbs rice/white vinegar

mixed together: 1/4 C water and 2 Tbs cornstarch

Mix together ingredients, and add to skillet with cooked protein of choice. Stir and simmer until thickened, and serve!
