1/3 C parmesan cheese

bs chicken boobs

1/4 C diced onion, or 1 tsp dried minced onion

2 Tbs butter

2 Tbs flour, and 1 Tbs flour

2 C milk

1 bag fresh spinach, cooked and drained

Preheat oven to 350. Grease 8x8 baking dish.

Combine cheese and 1 Tbs flour. Roll chicken in mixture, and place on prepared pan. If you use a lot of chicken, it's ok to smoosh it together. 

In medium saucepan, saute onion in butter. Stir in flour and then add milk, and simmer until bubbly. Remove from heat. Add cooked spinach, and pour over chicken. Cover with any remaining cheese mixture. 

Bake, uncovered, for 35 minutes. This is excellent served over rice or pasta!
