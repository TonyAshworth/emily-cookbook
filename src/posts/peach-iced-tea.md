Syrup:

* 1 C sugar
* 1 C water
* 2-3 peaches, sliced

Tea:

* 3 tea bags
* 6 C water

Bring syrup ingredients to a simmer in a saucepan, and continue to stir until sugar is dissolved and peaches are crushed. Remove from heat. 

While syrup is cooling, boil water and stew tea bags for 5 minutes, tossing tea bags and refridgerating tea. 

Strain syrup to remove fruit, and add to cold tea, stirring well. So good served with ice!
