Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 

Cut maybe 4 to 6 large potatoes into bite sized cubes. Spread onto cookie sheet and pour olive oil over the potatoes, and mix to coat potatoes and the pan. Sprinkle your favorite seasoning on them (we love Paul Prudhomme's poultry magic, I swear it makes the potatoes taste amazing). Bake for 10 minutes and stir, and then back for another 10 to 20 (depends on potato size) until they begin to brown. YUMMY!
